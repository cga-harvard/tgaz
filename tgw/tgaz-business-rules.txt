1.3   There can't be more than one spelling using the same transcription-system value.

4.1   If src_note_ref is NULL, the uri field must not be NULL
4.2   If src_note_ref is not NULL, value must be unique

For scripts:

5.1   When spelling is a transcription, use special script.id "0" for "not applicable"
      This allows NOT NULL constraint and easier querying

6.1   When spelling is a transcription, use special trsys.id "na" for "not applicable"
      This allows NOT NULL constraint and easier querying.
