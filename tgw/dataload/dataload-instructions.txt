-- DO NOT RUN THE REFERENCED SQL FILES AS STAND-ALONE SCRIPTS


-- The following steps must be done in order.  It is possible to
--  turn off the foreign key constraints, but this is unlikely to
--  end well.

-- Create the TGAZ database in MySQL / MariaDb
--   UTF-8 encoding with the corresponding character set
--   The end product tables will be using the INNODB Engine as expressed in the DDL
--   The intermediate load tables can use the devault MyISAM engine

-- Create the end product tables in the following files using the mysql source command:
--     tgw-lookup-ddl.sql
--     tgw-entity-ddl.sql
--   Additional tables, as needed:
--     tgw-calc-ddl.sql
--     tgw-fudan-ddl.sql

-- The five "lookup" tables must be populated first
-- The small tables "data_src", "script", "drule", "trsys" are populated in the DDL
-- "ftype" (for feature types) is loaded from a source csv through an intermediate table "ftype_xx"
--   using the commands in the file ftypes-load.sql.  Note that these commands will need
--   adjusting to get the correct source file name, etc.  It is recommended to run each command 
--   separately in the initial round. 
-- "snote" (for source note) is handled similarly using the commands in the file snotes-load-sql.      


-- Populate the "placename" table. 
--  Load the data for the intermediate tables "main_xx" and "gis_xx" per the commands in
--  the file placename-load.sql.  
-- The command to insert into the spelling table is included.  
-- The command to load the pres_loc table is included.  


-- Populate the prec_by table.
--   Use precby-load.sql
-- Populate the part_of table.
--   Use partof-load.sql

-- To support the PHP web application code, create the views in tgw-views.sql
