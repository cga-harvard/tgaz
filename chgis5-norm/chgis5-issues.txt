chgis5 schema questions outstanding:

* basic problem of not using the 'handle id' as the primary key 

* spelling script as enum ? 
* is name_utf 'vernacular with traditional script'?
* is name_utf_alt 'vernacular with simplified script'?
* switch 'transcription_of_id' to the actual vernacular text ?? 
  or just indicate the type of referenced name, e.g. vernacular (does script matter?)
  or is this field needed at all?
* status of 'alternate_of_id' ? 
* convert xy coords to floats from varchar?
* RAS gis_info have some repeats of sys_ids for apparent variants ?? up to 7
    but a few anomalies from other sources: 14831, cts_513337, relig_1354 
* RAS has utf_name in Russian (cyrillic) - are these 'transcriptions' with no vernacular?
  along with a py transcription.  See ras_999 where there is a py_name variant that
  corresponds to a gis variant -- this does not break our model, I think.
  Do I need to process the different sources separately? 
* To make the schema more generally applicable, should we separate the FUDON fields into
  a separate table that can easily be left off?  (This is where mongo would be useful.)
