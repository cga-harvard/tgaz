chgis5 schema questions
  * answered
  ^ outstanding:

^ basic problem of multiple ids in tables with one the primary key.  With placename table, Lex will work to make the sys_id unique,
  though it will need to be a varchar since is not always just a number. 

* spelling.script as enum - yes, see DDL
* In chgis3 schema, name_utf is for 'vernacular with simplified script' and name_utf_alt 'vernacular with traditional script'?
* Remove field spelling.transcription_of_id which would have specified the original vernacular spelling, not a problem that needs solving 
* status of 'alternate_of_id' - make a field in the placename table, not the spelling table 
* convert xy coords to floats from varchar - no.
* RAS gis_info have some repeats of sys_ids for apparent variants ?? up to 7
    but a few anomalies from other sources: 14831, cts_513337, relig_1354 
* RAS has utf_name in Russian (cyrillic) - are these 'transcriptions' with no vernacular?
  along with a py transcription.  See ras_999 where there is a py_name variant that
  corresponds to a gis variant -- this does not break our model, I think.
  Do I need to process the different sources separately? 
* To make the schema more generally applicable, should we separate the FUDON fields into
  a separate table that can easily be left off?  (This is where mongo would be useful.)
